# savesoundcloud

Savesoundcloud makes it easy to export your soundcloud data to .csv for archival purposes. The following **public** (private tracks will not be available) information is gathered, converted to csv and zipped together for your convenience:

- Favorited tracks
- Tracks
- Comments
- Playlists (with each playlist having a separate .csv file in a `playlists` folder.
- Followers
- Users followed

I do not guarantee that the information will be 100% complete, as the SoundCloud API will not always return what you see on the website, depending on the preferences of the content owner.
